I will make a an educational game for kids with Autism in schools.

The Characters

Zuberi – A curious and energetic 6-year-old  boy who loves exploring new places.
Tian – A thoughtful 6-year-old boy who is creative and enjoys playing with friends.
Lily – A calm and creative 5-year-old girl who enjoys drawing and playing.
Buddy the Dog – A playful, loyal golden retriever who loves helping Tian, Zuberi, and Lily make new friends. Buddy communicates through simple barks and animated gestures

Story overview

The game is set in Social Land, a magical world where kids learn how to interact with others in various social settings. Tian, Zuberi, Lily, and Buddy go on daily adventures in different environments like the playground, school, neighborhood, and park. Each environment introduces new characters (kids, adults, strangers), and the objective is for the player to help Max and Lily engage in simple, real-world social interactions, such as greeting others, asking for help, sharing, and making friends.

The game will continue.....
